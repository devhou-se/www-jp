Yesterday, my friend drank too much, so he slept until the afternoon. However, I didn't drink too much, so I woke up in the morning. Julia also woke up in the morning. We wanted to go buy knives in Asakusa.

We took the train to Asakusa at 9:30. When we got to Asakusa, we saw a Don Quijote store. So, we went inside. There were many Pokemon plushies. Also, there was a huge bottle of Japanese whiskey. I was surprised!

Also, I ate Mitarashi Dango for the first time. I love Mitarashi Dango!!! It's really delicious! Now, Mitarashi Dango is my favorite Japanese snack.

After that, we went to Kappabashi Street. Julia left her knife there until 3pm to be sharpened. Then we went to Yanaka Cemetery. We saw the gravestone of Tokugawa Yoshinobu. An elderly woman kindly showed us the way to the gravestone.

After that, we went to Ueno Park. There was a festival going on there. We ate yakisoba and sakura mochi. After that, we went back to the knife shop and "Tsubaya". We bought this knife there.

In the evening, we had yakiniku for dinner.

Today, we're going to Shibuya. We want to go to Meiji Shrine.

Well, see you later.
