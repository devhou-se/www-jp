Yesterday, my friend drank too much and slept in the afternoon. But, I didn't drink too much, so I woke up in the morning. Julia also woke up in the morning. We wanted to go buy a knife in Asakusa.

We got on the train to Asakusa at 9:30. When we arrived in Asakusa, we saw a Don Quixote. Then we went inside. They had a lot of Pokemon plush toys. And, there was a big bottle of Japanese whiskey. I was really surprised!

Then, I ate Mitarashi Dango for the first time. I love Mitarashi Dango!!! It is very delicious! Now, Mitarashi Dango is my favorite Japanese sweet.

Then we went to Kappabashi. We left Julia's knife to be sharpened at about 3 PM. Then we went to Yanaka Cemetery. We saw the tombstone of Tokugawa Yoshinobu. A kind elderly woman showed us the way to the tombstone.

Then we went to Ueno Park. There was a festival there. We ate Yakisoba and Sakuramochi. Then we went back to the knife store "Tsubaya". We bought this knife.

The dinner at night was Yakiniku.

Today, we will go to Shibuya. We want to visit Meiji Jingu Shrine.

That's all for now, see you!
