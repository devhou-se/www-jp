Yesterday, my friend drank too much and slept in the afternoon. However, I didn't drink too much, so I woke up in the morning. Julia also woke up in the morning. We wanted to go buy some knives in Asakusa.

At 9:30, we boarded a train for Asakusa. When we got to Asakusa, we saw a Don Quijote store. We decided to go inside. Inside, there was plenty of Pokemon plush toys and large Japanese whiskey bottles. We were truly surprised!

For the first time, I tasted mitarashi dango. I love them!!! They're absolutely delicious! Now, mitarashi dango is my favorite Japanese sweet.

Next, we went to Kappabashi. We left Julia's knife there to be sharpened until 3pm. Then we went to Yanaka Cemetery. We saw the grave of Tokugawa Yoshinobu. A kind elderly woman showed us the way to the grave.

After that, we went to Ueno Park. There was a festival happening there. We ate yakisoba and sakura mochi. After, we returned to the knife shop, "Tsubaya". We bought this knife.

In the evening, we had yakiniku for dinner.

Today we are going to Shibuya. We want to go to Meiji Jingu-mae.

See you later.
